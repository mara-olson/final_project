4/30
1. Should I collapse my sx_logs into general mense_logs? Is the second table worthwhile?

2. Should I store scalar data as strings or integers? For plotting on a graph maybe it makes sense to have an integer?
	 Flow_volume: (light, medium, heavy) vs. (1 - 3)

3. Should I store the following data on a scale, or as booleans? 
	Mood, fatigue, cramps, bloating
	Sleep_quality

4. Seeding data: users have to be committed to db before user_id can be referenced -- do I have to commit each createâ€¦ function info before the next?
