1. Should I collapse my sx_logs into general mense_logs? Is the second table worthwhile?

2. Should I store scalar data as strings or integers? For plotting on a graph maybe it makes sense to have an integer?
	 Flow_volume: (light, medium, heavy) vs. (1 - 3)

3. Should I store the following data on a scale, or as booleans? 
	Mood, fatigue, cramps, bloating
	Sleep_quality

4. Seeding data: users have to be committed to db before user_id can be referenced -- do I have to commit each createâ€¦ function info before the next?

5. Should flash messages be in the base.html file? And should it be a <p>?
	{% for msg in get_flashed_messages() %}
    <p class="flash-msg">{{ msg }}</p>

6. user.strava_user or user.mense_log etc. returns a list rather than an object. Is that expected?

7. Calendar vs. list of activities?

8. secret.sh, API key, OAuth

9. /{userid}/profile or just /profile?

10. How do I want to indicate the presence of period info in calendar square -- dot symbol? pink background? red date number?

11. Why doesn't the form show up from navbar navigation?

12. *** Fetch vs. Jinja *** How do I pass data?

13. For a new user, how can I create a new one with all the data fields that they've entered but only require email & password?

14. DateTime to readable date

15. Session["email"] do anything?
