4/30
	- Data model approved
		- Removed "logs" table, as it was redundant. Activity, mense, & sleep logs can all stand on their own
		- Sleep logs to be left out of MVP

	- Files created & organized
		- Templates
			- base.html (empty)
			- homepage.html (empty)
		- requirements.txt (copied from ratings-v2 lab)
		- Model.py
			- Created data classes
			- connect_to_db()
			- db
		- Server.py 
			- flask app
		- Seed_functions.py
		- Data
			- Seed data
				- JSON files for each data table
					users, strava_users, strava_activities, activity_logs, mense_logs
				- functions:
					create_users, create_strava_users, create_strava_activities, create_activities, create_mense_log
			- Learned that I must commit each seed data/function after it's defined rather than once at the end, or else the user_id doesn't exist (and the other data tables rely on mapping to the user_id, so they error out)
	TO_DO:
		x - Finish seed functions for mense_logs and sleep_logs
		x - Make sure seed data for each has all of the fields (can be null)

5/1
	- Seed data completed!
