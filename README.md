# floChart
Fitness training periods and menstrual periods don't happen in isolation, and understanding how they interact on a personalized level can drastically improve performance and well-being.
<br><br>FloChart is a web tracking app that allows users to log both acitivities and menses/symptoms, visualize their overlay in both a monthly calendar and graph, as well as see various stats. 
FloChart also allows users to authorize syncing with [Strava](https://www.strava.com/), so that all of their fitness tracking lives in one place.
