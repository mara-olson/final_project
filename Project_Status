4/30
	- Data model approved
		- Removed "logs" table, as it was redundant. Activity, mense, & sleep logs can all stand on their own
		- Sleep logs to be left out of MVP

	- Files created & organized
		- Templates
			- base.html (empty)
			- homepage.html (empty)
		- requirements.txt (copied from ratings-v2 lab)
		- Model.py
			- Created data classes
			- connect_to_db()
			- db
		- Server.py 
			- flask app
		- Seed_functions.py
		- Data
			- Seed data
				- JSON files for each data table
					users, strava_users, strava_activities, activity_logs, mense_logs
				- functions:
					create_users, create_strava_users, create_strava_activities, create_activities, create_mense_log
			- Learned that I must commit each seed data/function after it's defined rather than once at the end, or else the user_id doesn't exist (and the other data tables rely on mapping to the user_id, so they error out)
	TO_DO:
		x - Finish seed functions for mense_logs and sleep_logs
		x - Make sure seed data for each has all of the fields (can be null)

5/1
	- Seed data completed!
		- JSON files for sleep_logs
		- functions: create_mense_log, create_sleep_log
	- Wireframing


5/2
	- base.html -> index.html
	- App.jsx, Card.jsx, Homepage.jsx
	- Wireframing cont'd
	TO-DO
		x - Create folders per page (landing, login, homepage, profile)


5/5
	- <script> in index.html for each new component
		Probably makes more sense to put all components in a single file at this point
	- All components must be in static because Flask browser only looks there

5/7
	- Condensing all components into a single file in /static folder so that I don't have to add <script> in index.html for multiple files
	- Problems with getting a /login page:
		- <scripts> for Components.jsx and App.jsx must come AFTER body to avoid "Target container is not DOM element" error
		- <div id="root" must come before {% block content %}
		- {% block content %} instead of {% block body %} in order to allow other things in the body (?)
	- Could not get flash messages to show!
		Turns out methods=post needed to change to method(no "s")="post"
	- Opted for error=error_message rather than flash because I can control placement
	- Made the error message red with .error class in css
	- Successfully retrieved user's name/email from login page submission & displayed in flash message
	TO-DO:
		- Sort out React/AJAX vs. HTML/Jinja (right now I have both fetches and {{}}'s')
		- If going with react/ajax, remove all non-index .html files

5/8
	- Blergh, all the struggles
	- ~4 hours spent trying to make both React & Jinja work together to pass data, ended up abandoning fetches
	- Added @classmethod for Users to create a new user & commit to db, for sake of sign-up
	- Check if email used in sign-up is in db; if so, flash a message that an account already exists with that email. If not, go ahead & create/commit new user and then redirect to their homepage

	TO-DO:
		- Above ^^
